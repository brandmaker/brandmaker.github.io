<p>Media Pool provides a central place to store and manage digital assets in any format, for any device, and for any purpose. Diverse assets, such as files, videos, and images, can be imported, viewed, downloaded, shared as well as deleted by the user.  The management of assets also enables versioning, tagging and grouping as well as editing of asset properties.</p>
<p>With the help of the integrated search function, both individual and preconfigured search queries can be carried out, which are additionally supported by AI-based image tagging. Digital rights give internal and external team members role-based access to your digital library. Additionally, version and license management ensure the use of only current and valid content.</p>
<p>Within our BrandMaker landscape, Media Pool can be used in conjunction with other modules, for example as a repository for the Brand Management Portal or for creating content organized in the Marketing Planner. Media Pool also supplements the data in the Marketing Data Hub and provides key figures for individual assets via the Reporting Center.</p>
